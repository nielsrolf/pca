# Principal Component Analysis Using SVD

I use PCA quite often, mainly for visualization. This little project is basically a class that I implemented way too often and that provides a nice API to fit PCA to data and use it.

## Install
```
python setup.py install  # or python setup.py develop
```

## Test
```
pytest tests
```

# Usage
## Whiten and unwhiten the data

## Correlate and decorrelate the data

## Plot eigenvalues
